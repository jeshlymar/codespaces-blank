			  <p>I consider myself to be quite bubbly but with a timid personality. I give all my efforts to everything that I do because I believe that if you are going to do something either give it your all or don't give it anything at all. I'm from Puerto Rico but I was mostly raised in the states. I have various ongoing collections and I love gardening. Gardening to me much like shopping is therapeutic. To me, gardening is giving life in return for my life. If I was given life, why not create more life in nature? My own success and growth can be seen over the years much like the growth of a plant. I love to look at the clouds as well. I could be outside all day just staring at the sky and taking in all the clouds. Its one of the many reasons that I often have to be led when in public. Im usually staring at the sky as I walk to admire the clouds. Reading is also something that I like to do on my own time although I do admit that I haven't been reading as frequently as I used to but I would like to get back into it. Another important part of my life is my fur babies. I have two yorkies that give me all the joy in the world. They are my beautiful chaos. I would take them with me everywhere if I could. </p>
