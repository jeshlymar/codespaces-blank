                <p>Welcome to an inside view of my daily life and journey in college as a senior. College life can be both exciting as we learn more and also stressful with the workload and management of assignments. This site is meant to give you an insight on me and give you a chance to learn more about me.</p>

                <h2>Featured Guest: ME</h2>
				
                <p>While I take my education very seriously, I think a good work life balance is essential to living a happy life. I plan to get two certifications this semester so that I can increase my computer science skills and make my resume stand out more. Once I graduate next semester, I will be job hunting and I hope to get a job closer to Atlanta and the ultimate goal is to work at Microsoft.  In my personal life, I aim to do something out of my comfort zone at least once a month. I dedicate time to my family and friends and go on frequent trips to not let myself get looped into a cycle of endless work</p>
